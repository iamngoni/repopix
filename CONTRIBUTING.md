# Contributing to RepoPix

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Branch Naming Conventions
We use specific branches for different types of work:
- `feat/`: Prefix for new features or enhancements.
- `fix/`: Prefix for bug fixes.

Examples:
- `feat/sorting-algorithm`
- `fix/data-loading-error`

This helps in organizing our branches and making it clear what type of work each branch contains.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the [MIT License](LICENSE)
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [License](LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Commit Message Format
All commit messages should be formatted using specific prefixes to denote the type of change you're making:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks
- `wip:` for work in progress (not ready for merge)

Examples:
- `feat: add new sorting algorithm`
- `fix: correct typo in main function`
- `chore: update dependencies`
- `wip: implementing search functionality`

This helps in streamlining the development process and keeping the commit history clean and easy to navigate.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/iamngoni/repofix/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* You can adapt these based on your project's requirements.
* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* etc.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [MIT License](LICENSE).
